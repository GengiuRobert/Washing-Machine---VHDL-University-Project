Hello, this is my project for my Logic Design class and Digital System Design class from the 1st year of my CS major.
I had to simulate how a washing machine is working.
We used an app called Logisim Evolution where we wrote the VHDL code for our components.
All the work was simulated on a BASYS-3 board.
